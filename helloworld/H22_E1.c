1. Assume that the following paragraph of Tao Te Ching is saved in a text file called
LaoTzu.txt:
Be bent, and you will remain straight.
Be vacant, and you will remain full.
Be worn, and you will remain new.
Write a program to use ftell() to find the positions of the three strings in the file,
and then call fseek() to set the file position indicator in such a way that the three
strings are printed out in reverse order.
